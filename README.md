Paolo does a lot of on call work (emergency work such as leaks, burst pipes etc.) and therefore needs visitors to his website to be able to get in touch with him quickly. He also does more intricate residential plumbing work so needs to be able to showcase his work in a clear way and for potential customers to be able to get in touch with him with details of the work they need done. 
Due to the nature of the serices he provides, adults of all ages need to be able to use therefore it is imperative that the site is both user-friendly and accesible so as to appeal to as wide an audience as possible.
